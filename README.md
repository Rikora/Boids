# Boids

Boids is an artificial life program, developed by Craig Reynolds in 1986, which simulates the flocking behavior of birds. The traditional rules applied to simulate the flocking behavior are as follows:

* Alignment
* Cohesion
* Separation 

More complex rules can also be added, such as obstacle avoidance and goal seeking.
